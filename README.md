## üìù Usage

- Run the `R-ESRGAN-AnimeVideo-UI.pyw` script to launch the UI.
- ¬†Select a video file that you want to upscale.
- ¬†Follow the steps labeled in the UI.

**Note:** The `Upscale` and `Merge` operations delete the previous frames by default. If you want to keep the frames, make sure to enable the `Keep Frames` option.

After Extracting or Upscaling, you have the option to scale the frames to any size, either by percent or exact resolution.

`mp4`, `gif`, `avi`, `mkv`, `webm`, `mov`, `m4v`, `wmv`, are supported.

- Other Uses:
  - Batch Upscale a folder of images.
  - Upscale a single image.
  - You can also use these model for upscaling: `RealESRGAN_General_x4_3`, `realesrgan-x4plus`, `realesrgan-x4plus-anime`
  - Output any video as a gif, and/or output gif as mp4.


## ü§∑ Why?

Why use this over an application like [Chainner](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer), or [Topaz Video AI](https://www.topazlabs.com/)?

While both applications are undoubtedly more than capable, *(among others, I'm sure)* I found [xinntao's](https://github.com/xinntao) implementation is extremely fast compared to Chainner. And of course free is always better than Topaz Video AI's high cost.

Other upscale models are popular, but [realesr-animevideov3](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/blob/master/docs/anime_video_model.md) remains a favorite of mine for multiple reasons.
- It's very fast. [Speed Tests](https://github.com/Nenotriple/R-ESRGAN-AnimeVideo-UI/wiki/Speed-Tests)
- While it does have somewhat heavy smoothing, it doesn't totally destroy fine details like grain.
- In my opinion, it has superb line reconstruction compared to others like `RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B`

## üö© Requirements

**You must have Python 3.10+ installed to the system PATH**

**Running the script will automatically fulfill all requirements.**

The `pillow` library will be downloaded and installed (if not already available) upon first launch.

`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` will be downloaded upon first launch.

`realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan-20220424-windows.zip` and the required models will be downloaded upon launch.


## üìú Version History

[v1.11 changes:](https://github.com/Nenotriple/R-ESRGAN-AnimeVideo-UI/releases/tag/v1.11-Hotfix)

- New:
  - `Tools Menu`: This new menu is now where you access Batch and Single image upscale, along with Resize.
  - `clear folder`: Added a confirmation dialog to these File options.
  - `Batch Upscale`: Selecting an output folder is now optional. Images will output to "source/output" if no folder is selected.
  - You can now right click the thumbnail to progress the displayed frame by ~2sec.
  - Gif files are now animated in the UI, updated every 120ms (may not display at full speed).
  - When a video is selected, its size, current dimensions, the selected scale factor, and the upscaled dimensions are displayed.
  - Surprised or sad text faces are displayed for mild errors. (√≥Ô∏π√≤ ÔΩ°) (e.g., no video selected, invalid file type).
  - `Keep Frames` options are now always available. Sometimes you may wish to change your mind during a long process
<br>

- Fixed:
  - Improved robustness of media info collection.
    - Total frames are now approximated for video streams that don't declare their total frames. This can lead to a slight discrepancy with the reported extracted frames. All frames will be extracted regardless.
  - Invisible tooltips no longer obstruct the checkboxes.
  - The chosen upscale model is now applied to both Batch and Single image upscale.
  - `Batch Upscale`: The elapsed timer now correctly updates in the UI.
  - `Resize`: No longer displays "Done Resizing!" immediately after running.
  - `Extract Frames`: This process can now be stopped.
  - Double-clicking is now required on the thumbnail to open the video directory.
    - This helps to prevent accidental openings when clicking the window.
  - Opening the video directory by clicking the thumbnail is less prone to issues.
    - The script now uses "os.startfile" instead of "subprocess.Popen 'explorer'", preventing multiple folder windows from opening when the folder is already open.
  - Stopping a process now properly updates the ui instead of stating "Done! ..."

___
[v1.10 changes:](https://github.com/Nenotriple/R-ESRGAN-AnimeVideo-UI/releases/tag/v1.10)

- New:
  - You can now use other upscale models. `RealESRGAN_General_x4_v3, realesrgan-x4plus, realesrgan-x4plus-anime`
  - 1x scaling is now supported. Note: This is not recommended. [See comparison.](https://github.com/Nenotriple/R-ESRGAN-AnimeVideo-UI/wiki/Comparisons)
  - You can now output any video as a gif and export high-quality or low-quality gifs. See [this section of the wiki](https://github.com/Nenotriple/R-ESRGAN-AnimeVideo-UI/wiki/Gif-creation-and-settings) for details on getting the most out of this feature.
  - Percent, ETA, and FPS are now displayed during the image scaling process.
  - You can now resize extracted or upscaled frames by percentage or exact resolution.  
- Fixed:
  - Buttons are properly grayed out after merging.
