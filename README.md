## üìù Usage

- Run the `R-ESRGAN-AnimeVideo-UI.pyw` script to launch the UI.
-  Select a video file that you want to upscale.
-  Follow the steps labeled in the UI.

**Note:** The `Upscale` and `Merge` operations delete the previous frames by default. If you want to keep the frames, make sure to enable the `Keep Frames` option.

After upscaling, you have the option to scale the frames back down to their original size.

mp4, gif, avi, mkv, webm, mov, m4v, wmv, are supported.

## ü§∑ Why?

Why use this over an application like [Chainner](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer), or [Topaz Video AI](https://www.topazlabs.com/)?

While both applications are undoubtedly more than capable, *(among others I'm sure)* I found [xinntao's](https://github.com/xinntao) implementation is extremely fast compared to Chainner. And of course free is always better than Topaz Video AI's high cost.

Other upscale models are popular, but [realesr-animevideov3](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/blob/master/docs/anime_video_model.md) remains a favorite of mine for multiple reasons.
- It's very fast.
- While it does have somewhat heavy smoothing, it doesn't totally destroy fine details like grain.
- In my opinion it has superb line reconstruction compared to others like `RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B`

    - You can now click on the video preview to open the source folder.
    - You can now output gif files as mp4 (default) or gif format, for a general increase in quality and reduced file size.

    - Issue where pressing stop while auto was enabled would still continue to the next steps.
    - Issue where subfolders present in raw_frames, upscaled_frames, and batch upscale output would cause an error.
    - Issue where details during batch upscale would be incorrect if images were already present in the selected output folder.
